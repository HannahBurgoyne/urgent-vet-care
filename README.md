# Urgent Vet Care 

### Premise 
This project was inspired by my flatmate, who wanted an app which could easily and quickly help them find an urgent care veterinary clinic for their pet in an emergency situation. 

I chose to build this as a mobile app so that a user can easily and quickly get the information which they need, right in their pocket. There are currently two sections envisioned for this app; a map interface which shows you all available vet clinics around your location which are open now for urgent care, and a section where a user can save their favourite clinics to persistent data storage so that they can quickly find the opening details of their preferred clinic in the moment.

### Technical details
The backend is built in Microsoft .NET Core, as I wanted to gain more experience working with .NET. The frontend is built in React Native. It utilises the Google Maps and Places APIs respectively to read a user's current location, and dynamically show a list of clinics in the surrounding area. 
Originally I was developing this app for Android. Now due to software and hardware constraints, I am pivoting to developing for iOS but still hope to continue developing for Android as well.

### Current status
This project is still very much in progress, however my aim is to soon have a working MVP which allows a user to: 
- View a list of all urgent care vet clinics currently open near them
- Allows them to view the details of a clinic, prioritising important information such as contact details first
- Allows them to save a clinic to a list of favourites, which they can access again at a later time
